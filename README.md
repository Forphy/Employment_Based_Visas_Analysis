# CS263_Project

To clone my github repo, do this in terminal:
git clone https://github.com/ericucsc/Employment_Based_Visas_Analysis.git
Otherwise, you may as well download the datafile from its source webpage.
I download the data file “PERM_Disclosure_Data_FY16.xlsx” on the webpage “OFLC Performance Data - U.S. Department of Labor”.

To get query results to csv files for PERM:	python perm.py query
To get the visualization-ready csv files for PERM:
	python perm.py viz
To get the visualization-ready html file for PERM:
	python plot.py perm
To get the visualization-ready html file for H1B:
	python plot.py h1b
To view the Visualization, open the file index.html on your browser,
recommend to use Safari, Firefox. Chrome might crash in some circumstance.
